Regular expressions always seemed to be pretty daunting, with all those weird characters arranged in a particular way seemed to somehow accomplish complicated tasks such as matching all the varied set of patterns a certain string input could be in or find and replace its substrings which matched a certain pattern. Almost always, working with a deadline looming, my approach was to search for the right regular expression that would fit the need then test it with a varied set of inputs and get on with the rest of the work.

Lately I decided to brush up and a delve a bit deeper into this seemingly complicated and geeky art of conjuring up regular expressions. I tried looking up resources that could help me and then found the ones below

1. https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-regular-expressions-with-this-free-course-37511963d278/
2. https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/regular-expressions/
3. https://regexone.com/
4. https://github.com/ziishaned/learn-regex
5. https://www.regular-expressions.info/tutorial.html
6. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhzKDrUiJVk 

After quickly skimming through I found 1, 3, 4, 6 at beginner level & 2, 5 a bit more elaborate of the first set I chose 6 the [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhzKDrUiJVk) from [web dev simplified](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFbNIlppjAuEX4znoulh0Cw) as it seemed straight to the point from the word go. The video as the title suggests really helped me understand the regular expressions real quick so kudos to the channel. I also went through 3 which helped me further understand and apply my learning.

So let me summarize what i learnt from these sources. I have used the [Regexr](https://regexr.com) site to try out all the concepts explained in the video which is also suggested by the video.

1. Search by literal characters
    when we think of a string it is basically a sequence of characters and with regualar expressions we write patterns which match a certain sequence of characters but in simplest of cases those patterns themselves can be literal characters.
