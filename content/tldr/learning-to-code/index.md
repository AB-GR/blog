### Showcase your skills
As a newbie programmer zubin did several of the online learning courses many times as he used to quickly forget what he learned, but later he realized that understanding was more important and hence focussed on developing his knowledge.

There was another problem where he understood things but couldnt put into practice or build much. Then he turned to some other resources which helped him land job offers. 
He started upskilling - there is an important difference between knowledge and skill. Skill is applied knowledge. As one interviewer put it: "We don't hire for knowledge. We hire for skill."

How do you showcase your skills? Think of it this way - the finest department stores still need to showcase their wares in the shop windows right? So think about the resources you've used to learn and ask yourself this :  what have you got to show for it?

It turns out that the reason for zubins success was his GitHub Profile. He took a number of courses that were long and intense, but which were project-based.  Because they were long and intensive, and project-based he had to use Github to store my code as he went along.  And it turned out that my Github profile was what impressed the hiring managers - they loved that he had a lot of projects there.  It turns out that most applicants have weak Github profiles.  

### Why learn by dates fail
When we are inspired to set goals, what inspires us are the outcomes not the process. Setting outcome goals is what drives people to action, but without process goals, the outcome is seriously at risk.

Outcome driven goals are : I am going to learn HTML this month. Then next month I’m going to do JavaScript.

Knowing how much time it takes to achieve a goal and how much time you can commit to regularly will decide when you you can expect to achieve that goal by.

Process driven goals are : This HTML course is 5 hours long I am going to finish in a day or in 5 days with 1 hour each day.

And this one shift in approach will greatly improve your odds of success. This way you will know if something is going to take you 6 or 12 or 18 months. No nasty surprises — and you can build a solid plan around that, and prepare yourself for the journey.
