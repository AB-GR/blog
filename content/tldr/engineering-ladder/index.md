### The framework
Engineering ladders defines 4 different roles such as 

 - Developer: role also known as programmer or software engineer, requires a deep level of technical expertise
 - Tech Lead: role also known as dev lead, is the owner of the system and requires a unique balance between hands-on development, architecture knowledge and production support
 - Technical Program Manager: role responsible for coordinating and driving to completion initiatives that span multiple teams
 - Engineering Manager: role also known as dev manager, is responsible for the consistent delivery, career growth and level of happiness of the team

 Each of these roles may have different levels based on seniority/skill/experience

 For instance `D1` is a junior developer while `D7` would be the senior most dev/IC role in an organization.

 Then there are different axes based on which work of each of these roles could be classified, they are
 - Technology: knowledge of the tech stack and tools
 - System: level of ownership of the system(s)
 - People: relationship with the team(s)
 - Process: level of engagement with the development process
 - Influence: scope of influence of the position

 The influence axis can be seen as a different dimension since it is orthogonal and applies to all the other axes.

Each axis has 5 different levels of performance. It is important to highlight that every level includes the previous one(s). For example, someone that evangelizes technology, specializes and adopts it as well.

### Mapping Roles/Levels to the Axes
This is what the mapping from Tech Lead(Level TL5) --> Axes would look like

 Essentially he :
 - Evangelizes: researches, creates proofs of concept and introduces new technologies to the team
 - Evolves: evolves the architecture to support future requirements and defines its SLAs
 - Coordinates: coordinates team members providing effective feedback and moderating discussions
 - Defines: defines the right processes for the team's maturity level, balancing agility and discipline
 - Team: makes an impact on the whole team, not just on specific parts of it

 Now if an individual were to the next level that is TL6 looking at the mapping below would give an idea what needs to be done.

 In addition to performing on all the points for TL5 he would have to

 - Masters: has very deep knowledge about the whole technology stack of the system
 - Leads: leads the technical excellence of the system and creates plans to mitigate outages
 - Multiple Teams: makes an impact not only on the whole team but also on other teams
