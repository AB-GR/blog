## Donts

### Do not stare at the mountain top
Dont rush, dont keep staring at that mountain top(your goal), competency takes time and mastery even longer, instead lower your gaze whats in front of you & enjoy the process of learning because you are gonna need that for the rest of your life. Keep checking the goal and you are bound to get discouraged.

### Dont mistake your doubts for evidence
We all have doubts, and sometimes doubt creates fear and this is part of growing, leaving your comfort zone but do not let your doubts dictate your perception about yourself it could stop you dead in your tracks, instead ignore the noise and keep walking one baby step at a time.

### Dont measure your reality against your secret wishes
Your secret wish could be attain mastery in a short amount of time while the reality could be that you still have a long way to go, but there is reason to cheer if you keep at things that you want to get good at as a matter of discipline and keep going longer than everyone else there comes up a point you will level up 1 or 2 points than where you were, stacking up knowledge compounds after a fair bit of time. again keep moving as a matter of discipline enjoy the process.

### Dont take big decisions on bad days
There will be days on this path where you will be overwhelmed, frustrated, fearful and when you feel like quitting, dont do that, instead let the hurricane of emotions pass, take a break for a day or a week and come back. Also dont take long breaks so that you never lose the momentum you will eventually get there.

### Dont assume your current results reflect your ability
True ability comes at the end of the journey, at the beginning there is frustrations, obstacles etc.The fact that you dont know how to do it doesnt mean you cannot do it. "Never let what you cannot stop you from what you can do" always what can I do. As an afterthough think of whatever you do now is pretty impressive from your ability 5 years ago.

## Dos
The dos have to become part of who you are

### Adopt growth mindset
Your abilities/skills are not fixed. Growth mindset is what takes you to from not knowing something to knowing it. As we age the growth mindset becomes a fixed mindset. A good growth mindset enables you to ask radically different questions when encountered with a problem, setback or failure.

### Make friends with the Imposter syndrome
This is a universal thing, difference between success and failure is how you deal with this. The heart of dealing with it is to understand that imposter syndrome is not real.

### Practice reframing failure
The natural reaction to failure is feeling down, negative or frustrated but the thing we need to understand is that when we set out for some goal the no of failures is always gonna be more than successes, in fact if the no of failures is not that many it means we are playing it safe. Another perspective is that if the failure gave you another data point to do it better the next time, or you learnt something new (failure teaches enduring lessons) then it was well worth the effort. The change of perspective should help you come out of the shackles and try harder and eventually succeed.

### Reduce the number of choices you have to make
Pick your goal, pick choices relevant to that goal and eliminate everything else, though this is very hard to do and comes with experience. Also the fewer choices you have the more accountable you will be.

### Focus on insight and not just implementations
Understand amongst different approaches what are the trade offs, gain insight, understand the class of problems, create a mental model, because in real life problem solving is all about understanding the patterns from your past experience and applying it to the current one.
